# Typing Speed Test App

A **Tkinter-based typing speed tester** that generates random sentences, tracks typing time, and calculates your typing speed and accuracy in real-time. Beginner-friendly and perfect for learning Python GUI development.



## Features

- **Random sentence generation** using Python's `random` module  
- **Auto-start timer** when typing begins  
- **Words Per Minute (WPM)** calculation  
- **Accuracy calculation** based on correct characters  
- **Real-time GUI updates**  
- **Restart/Test Again button**  
- **Tracks total characters typed**  
- **Simple and clean interface**  
- **Beginner-friendly code structure**  



## How It Works

1. **Sentence Display**:  
   - The program selects a random sentence from a predefined list and displays it to the user.  

2. **Timer Logic**:  
   - The timer starts automatically when the user types the first character in the input box.  

3. **WPM Calculation**:
    WPM = (Total characters typed / 5) ÷ Time in minutes

5. **Accuracy Calculation**:
    Accuracy (%) = (Correct characters / Total typed characters) × 100

7. **Live Updates**:  
   - The GUI shows WPM and accuracy instantly after the user finishes typing.
